## Features (Future Plans)

- **Automatic Storytelling:** Lightens the load for the "storyteller" by seamlessly managing the intricate mechanics of Blood on the Clocktower. This tool orchestrates night orders, complex role interactions, ensuring precision to eliminate mistakes during gameplay, sparing the need for mid-game [Fibbins](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Fibbin).
- **Script Generator:** Swiftly crafts custom scripts, ensuring validity and balance. Customizable difficulty settings, group sizes, and game durations cater to diverse player preferences.
- **Live Game Balancing System:** Dynamically adjusts responses within the game's confines to maintain equilibrium as the narrative unfolds, aiming for the climactic "final day." Examples include:
- **Guidance and Parity Generator:** Creates well-balanced Savant/Fisherman/General information.
- **Simplistic Character Additions** Allows for easy integration of new experimental characters, with an intuitive and robust framework.
