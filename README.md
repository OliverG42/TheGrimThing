# The Grim Thing!

*Welcome to The Grim Thing repository!*

## Overview

This project endeavors to bring to life a digital rendition of the cherished social deduction game "[Blood on the Clocktower](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Main_Page)," providing players with a sophisticated platform to immerse themselves in the game's intricate gameplay.

## Very Important Notice

## Features (Future Plans)

- **Automatic Storytelling:** Lightens the load for the "storyteller" by seamlessly managing the intricate mechanics of Blood on the Clocktower. This tool orchestrates night orders, complex role interactions, ensuring precision to eliminate mistakes during gameplay, sparing the need for mid-game [Fibbins](https://wiki.bloodontheclocktower.com/Fibbin).
- **Script Generator:** Swiftly crafts custom scripts, ensuring validity and balance. Customizable difficulty settings, group sizes, and game durations cater to diverse player preferences.
- **Live Game Balancing System:** Dynamically adjusts responses within the game's confines to maintain equilibrium as the narrative unfolds, aiming for the climactic "final day." Examples include:
  - A game tilting towards Good? Droisened players may receive obfuscated ambiguous information, with luck-based abilities favoring Evil.
  - Evil holding sway? Droisened players might get unambiguously true/false information, with luck-based abilities favoring Good.
- **Guidance and Parity Generator:** Creates well-balanced Savant/Fisherman/General information.
- **Simplistic Character Additions** Allows for easy integration of new experimental characters, with an intuitive and robust framework.
